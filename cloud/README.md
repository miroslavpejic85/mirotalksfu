# Cloud Recording

![cloud](./assets/cloud.png)

To save `recordings` on a different `server` or `cloud service` copy this `cloud folder` to the desired server.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

## Edit config.js

In the MiroTalk SFU `.env` file, change the endpoint to send recording chunks:

```bash
RECORDING_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080
```
